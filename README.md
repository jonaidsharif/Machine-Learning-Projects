# Machine-Learning-Projects


**Project - 01: ** SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python
 - > The prediction model is built using a Logistic Regression algorithm.

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
The objective of this project is to classify objects as either a rock or a mine using sonar signal data. We employ a Logistic Regression model to perform this binary classification task.

<h5>Dataset</h5>
The dataset used for this project is the SONAR dataset, which contains 208 instances with 60 attributes each, representing the energy of sonar signals bounced off different objects.


**Project - 02: ** Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains a Python project that predicts whether a person has diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements. The prediction model is built using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
The objective of this project is to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic using various medical diagnostic measurements. We employ a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to perform this binary classification task.

<h5>Dataset</h5>
The dataset used for this project is the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset, which includes 768 instances with 8 attributes representing medical measurements.
